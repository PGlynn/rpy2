# rpy2 in Jupyter Notebooks

This is just an example of how to use rpy2 inside of Jupyter Notebooks.  

It shows how to:
* Run a command in R
* Run an entire cell in R
* Pass variables between R and Python

It is worth noting that *all cells will default to Python* using this method.  So if you mostly work in R, this is not a great option, and you should instead consider IRKernel for using R inside of Jupyter Notebooks.  (https://github.com/IRkernel/IRkernel).  

The benefit of rpy2 is that inside of one notebook you can use both R and Python, and you can pass variables between the two easily.

I think I stole this example from somewhere, but I can't find the source.  If you do, please let me know and I will credit it!
